# London Cafe's / Neighborhood Map (React)

This is my final project in my nanodegree by Udacity. This project is coded in ReactJS.

## Purpose

This app functionality is to locate cafe's in London by map. It also includes a search functionality that filters out the markers by query. Beside that it's made with a11y in mind and offline-first approach.

## How to install

To install you first need to download by **git clone** or download button. Afterwards you should use **npm i** or **npm install** and then **npm start** to start the project.

### Google Maps

This application uses Google maps to display the markers.

### Foursquare

This application uses Foursquare to get information about the locations.
